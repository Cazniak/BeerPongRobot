# BeerPongRobot

This Beer Pong Robot was created for my Final Year Project as part of my Bachelor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at University of Newcastle in 2022. I decided to keep developing the project, hoping to get it to the point where it can act as a standalone display for potential students at the University's Open Days.
